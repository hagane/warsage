# Warsage ![status-enfer](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-enfer-orange.svg)
Warsage is a collection of D&D tools that I would like to use but no one else had implemented them.

## Usage
- `sbt run combat` -- run stochastic combat simulation (WIP, edit code to setup combat);
- `sbt run encounters --levels 5,5,6,7` -- build encounter plan for party with 2 level 5 characters, one level 6 character and one level 7 character.
